Subject: Urgent Input Needed: End-to-End Payment Validation Matrix (FED & ACH)
Hi all,
As discussed, we are putting together an end-to-end view of payment validation across all channels and
orchestration points for FED Wire and ACH flows. This has become an urgent ask from Ram, driven by
recent production issues, and we need to complete the initial validation presence matrix ASAP.
For now, this is not a detailed mappingjust a Yes/No input to indicate whether each validation category listed
applies within your respective domain/component.
We will double-click into details later, including how each validation is performed, specific rules, and
ownership. Right now, we need quick alignment on whether the validation type exists in your layer of
processing or not.
Owners & Areas:
- @Bronja, Bajro (CWM-NR) H2H Bulk File Orchestrator
- @Marok, Gurinder Portal / BFF
- @Singh, Anand Y External API
- @Khosla, Ratul R Single Payment Orchestrator / Domain API
- @Sood, Sameer Volpay FED & ACH Engine
Action Required:
Please fill in the matrix by end of day today with just YES / NO under your area for each validation category

Let me know if anything is unclear, but againspeed is key here so we can unblock the detailed follow-up
analysis.
Thanks,
