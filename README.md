Subject: Inquiry Regarding Book-to-Book Transfers and Related Processes
Dear Keyuri and Jennifer,
I hope this email finds you well. I have a few questions regarding our book-to-book transfer processes (where the customer account lies within RBC, including cases involving two different legal entities in Finacle). Could you please provide clarity on the following points?
	1	Fraud Checks for Book-to-Book Transfers: Do we perform fraud checks for book-to-book transfers?
	2	Sanction Checks for Book-to-Book Transfers: Are sanction checks conducted for book-to-book transfers?
	3	Rationale for Fraud/Sanction Checks: If fraud or sanction checks are performed for book-to-book transfers, is this due to leveraging the Fedwire VolPay flow and its associated restrictions, or are there specific business, regulatory, or compliance requirements driving these checks?
	4	Use of Fedwire VolPay for Book-to-Book Transfers: Why is the book-to-book transfer process routed through the Fedwire VolPay implementation (aside from determining payment instructions by analyzing beneficiary information)? If a transfer is clearly identified as book-to-book, is it still required to follow the Fedwire VolPay workflow?
Your insights on these points would be greatly appreciated to better understand the process and any underlying requirements. Please let me know if you need additional context or if we should schedule a discussion to go over this.
Thank you for your time and assistance.
